This code creates a simple Tkinter GUI for a BMI calculator. Users can input weight and height, calculate BMI, and view historical data with a button to show a plot. Note that the historical data is stored in memory and is not persistent; for a more advanced solution, you'd need to implement data storage and retrieval using a database or file system. Additionally, you may consider using more sophisticated statistical analysis tools for trend analysis.
